                      Parsing (Top-Down Parsing)
**Context free Grammar** 
-Set of Terminals T
-Set of Non-Terminals N
-Start Symbol 
-Set of Productions 

           Algorithms for Parsing (Recursive Descent Parsing) 
-from LEFT to RIGHT 
-from TOP to BOTTOM
 
                Limitation for Recursive Descent Parsing       
-No backtracking to try different productions once we have found a production that succeeds for non-terminal 
-Infinite Loop(Left Recursion) when S=Non terminal 
-Infinite Loop(Left Recursion) can be eliminated by hand,thus this limitation is not major  
 
Derivation = Sequence of Productions 
                     
Grammar is Ambiguous if it has more than one parse tree 
Divide(rewrite) Production into two classes to avoid ambiguity
Instead of rewrite the Grammar 
- Use the more Natural(Ambigious)Grammar 
- Along with disambiguating Associativity and Precedence Declaration 
                                                         %left+
                                                         %left*
 Error kind 
 -Lexical  ....$....
 -Syntax   ....x*%....
 -Semantic intx;y=x(3)
 
 Solution 
 -Panic Mode ---> Skip errors part 
 -Error Productions
